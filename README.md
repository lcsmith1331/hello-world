# hello-world
my first project named hello world here I come
I have worked as a professional graphic designer at UMass Amherst for almost 25 years. I'd like to retire in a few more years and plan to do some freelance work. If I know coding I think it could be a potential avenue for freelance work.
I just described what I hope to do when I'm retired.
